Nova host data leak to vm instance in rescue mode
-------------------------------------------------
:Date: March 27, 2014

:Description:

   Stanislaw Pitucha from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in the
   Nova instance rescue mode. By overwriting the disk inside an instance
   with a malicious image and switching the instance to rescue mode, an
   authenticated user would be able to leak an arbitrary file from the
   compute host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be
   readable by the libvirt/kvm context to be exposed. Only setups using
   libvirt to spawn instance, and having "use_cow_images = False" in Nova
   configuration are affected.
