Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups
--------------------------------------------------------
:Date: August 06, 2013

:Description:

   Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service
   vulnerability in Nova's handling of network source security group policy
   updates. By performing a large number of server creation operations, the
   proportion of updates increases quadratically and may overwhelm
   nova-network such that it is no longer able to service other requests in
   a timely fashion. Only setups relying on nova-network are affected.
