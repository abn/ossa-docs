Swift TempURL timing attack
---------------------------
:Date: January 16, 2014

:Description:

   Samuel Merritt from SwiftStack reported a timing attack vulnerability in
   Swift TempURL middleware. By analyzing response times to arbitrary
   TempURL requests, an attacker may be able to guess valid secret URLs and
   get access to objects that were only intended to be publicly shared with
   specific recipients. In order to use this attack, the attacker needs to
   know the targeted object name, and the object account needs to have a
   TempURL key set. Only Swift setups enabling the TempURL middleware are
   affected.
