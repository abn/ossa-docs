Extremely long passwords can crash Keystone
-------------------------------------------
:Date: March 27, 2012

:Description:

   Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in Keystone. He discovered that you
   can remotely trigger a crash in Keystone by sending an extremely long
   password. When Keystone is validating the password, glibc allocates
   space on the stack for the entire password. If the password is long
   enough, stack space can be exhausted, resulting in a crash. This
   vulnerability is mitigated by a patch to impose a reasonablelimit on
   password length (4 kB).
