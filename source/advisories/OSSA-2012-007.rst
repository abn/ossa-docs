Security groups fail to be set correctly
----------------------------------------
:Date: June 06, 2012

:Description:

   HP Cloud Services reported a vulnerability in Nova API handling. When a
   security group is created via the EC2 or OS API's that uses a protocol
   defined in the incorrect case i.e 'TCP' rather than 'tcp' it causes a
   later string comparison to fail. This leads to Security Groups not being
   set correctly. Once he ova DB has been polluted with the incorrect case
   any subsequent modifications to the security group will also fail. ake
   Nova resilient to any protocol case inconsistencies that may be in the
   Nova DB. Users may want to consider sanitizing their database by forcing
   all protocol entries to lower case, hardening their DB against any
   failures of future code that may expect the data to be lower case.
