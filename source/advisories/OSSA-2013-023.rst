Denial of Service using XML entities in Nova/Cinder extensions
--------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: August 08, 2013

:Description:

   Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported that vulnerabilities in XML request
   parsers were not fully patched in OSSA 2013-004. By leveraging XML
   entity expansion in specific extensions, an unauthenticated attacker may
   still consume excessive resources on the Nova (CVE-2013-4179) or Cinder
   (CVE-2013-4202) API servers, resulting in a denial of service and
   potentially a crash. Only Nova setups making use of the security group
   extension in Grizzly are affected. Only Cinder setups making use of the
   backups or volume transfer API extension in Grizzly are affected.
