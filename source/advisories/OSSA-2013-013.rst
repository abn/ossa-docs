Keystone client local information disclosure
--------------------------------------------
:Date: May 23, 2013

:Description:

   Jake Dahn from Nebula reported a vulnerability that the keystone client
   only allows passwords to be updated in a clear text command-line
   argument, which may enable other local users to obtain sensitive
   information by listing the process and potentially leaves a record of
   the password within the shell command history.
