Glance image_download policy not enforced for cached images
-----------------------------------------------------------
:Date: October 22, 2013

:Description:

   Stuart McLaren from HP reported a vulnerability in Glance download_image
   policy enforcement in the case of cached images. Deployers may opt to
   set a download_image policy to restrict image download to specific
   roles. However, when an image is previously cached by an authorized
   download, any authenticated user could download image contents if it can
   determine the image UUID, bypassing any download_image policy
   restrictions. This could result in disclosure of image contents that
   were thought to be protected by the download_image policy setting. Only
   setups making use of the download_image policy are affected.
