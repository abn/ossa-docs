Remote code execution in Glance Sheepdog backend
------------------------------------------------
:Date: April 10, 2014

:Description:

   Paul McMillan from Nebula reported a vulnerability in Glance Sheepdog
   backend. By using a specially crafted location, a user allowed to insert
   or modify Glance image metadata may trigger code execution on the Glance
   host as the user the Glance service runs under. This may result in
   Glance host unauthorized access and further compromise of the Glance
   service. All setups using Glance server with the (enabled by default)
   sheepdog backend are affected.
