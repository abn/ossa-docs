Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature
-----------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: June 19, 2013

:Description:

   Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation
   of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An
   attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a
   man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially
   bypass the encryption (CVE-2013-2166) or signing (CVE-2013-2167)
   security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of
   memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers)
   and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are
   affected.
