Token authorization for a user in a disabled tenant is allowed
--------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: September 28, 2012

:Description:

   Rohit Karajgi reported a vulnerability in Keystone. It was possible to
   get a token that is authorized for a disabled tenant. Once the token is
   established with authorization on the tenant, keystone would respond 200
   OK to token validation requests from other OpenStack services, allowing
   the user to work  with the tenant's resources.
