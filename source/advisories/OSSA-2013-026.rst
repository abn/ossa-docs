Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid
---------------------------------------------------
:Date: September 12, 2013

:Description:

   Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using
   Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending any random text longer than
   65K characters to an instance console and requesting the console log
   contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the
   nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could
   be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider.
   Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are
   affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like
   RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.
