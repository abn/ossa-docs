Extension of token validity through token chaining
--------------------------------------------------
:Date: November 28, 2012

:Description:

   Anndy reported a vulnerability in token chaining in Keystone. A token
   expiration date can be circumvented by creating a new token before the
   old one has expired. An authenticated and authorized user could
   potentially leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the
   account owner expectations. Note: this vulnerability was fixed in the
   past (CVE-2012-3426) but was reintroduced in Folsom when code was
   refactored to support PKI tokens.
