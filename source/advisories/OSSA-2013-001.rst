Boot from volume allows access to random volumes
------------------------------------------------
:Date: January 29, 2013

:Description:

   Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in volume attachment in
   nova-volume, affecting the boot-from-volume feature. By passing a
   specific volume ID,  an authenticated user may be able to boot from a
   volume he doesn't own, potentially resulting in full access to that
   3rd-party volume contents. Folsom  setups making use of Cinder are not
   affected.
