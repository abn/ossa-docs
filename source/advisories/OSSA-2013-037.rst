Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files
-----------------------------------------------------
:Date: December 18, 2013

:Description:

   Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the libvirt driver handling
   of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly
   creating snapshots, changing the os_type to a new random value, and
   spawning new instances from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those
   instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different
   ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially
   resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup. Only Nova setups
   running the libvirt driver are affected.
