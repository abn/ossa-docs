Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances
------------------------------------------------
:Date: December 11, 2012

:Description:

   Eric Windisch from Cloudscaling reported a vulnerability in libvirt
   LVM-backed instances. The physical volume content was not wiped out
   before being deallocated and passed to an instance, which may result in
   the disclosure of information from previously-allocated logical
   volumes.Only setups using libvirt and LVM-backed instances
   (libvirt_images_type=lvm) are affected.
