Scheduler denial of service through scheduler_hints
---------------------------------------------------
:Date: July 11, 2012

:Description:

   Dan Prince from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova scheduler
   nodes. By creating servers with malicious scheduler_hints, an
   authenticated user may generate a huge amount of database calls,
   potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack against Nova
   scheduler nodes. Only setups exposing the OpenStack API and enabling
   DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter are affected.
