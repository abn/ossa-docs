Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors
----------------------------------------------------
:Date: August 28, 2013

:Description:

   Ken'ichi Ohmichi from NEC reported that the fix for OSSA 2013-019
   (CVE-2013-2256) was incomplete. Any tenant was still able to boot any
   other tenant's private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This potentially
   allowed circumvention of any resource limits enforced through the
   os-flavor-access:is_public property.
