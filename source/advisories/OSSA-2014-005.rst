Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client
----------------------------------------------------
:Date: February 17, 2014

:Description:

   Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client was failing
   to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS
   connections. A remote attacker with access over segments of the network
   between client and server could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle
   attack and access the contents of the Swift client's communication with
   the server, including any used credentials.
