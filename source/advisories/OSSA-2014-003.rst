Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage
--------------------------------------------------------
:Date: January 23, 2014

:Description:

   Loganathan Parthipan from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in
   the Nova libvirt driver. By spawning a server with the same flavor as
   another user's migrated virtual machine, an authenticated user can
   potentially access that user's snapshot content resulting in information
   leakage. Only setups using KVM live block migration are affected.
