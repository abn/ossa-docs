Trustee token revocation does not work with memcache backend
------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: March 04, 2014

:Description:

   Morgan Fainberg from Metacloud reported a vulnerability in the Keystone
   memcache token backend. When a trustor issues a trust token with
   impersonation enabled, the token is only added to the trustor's token
   list and not to the trustee's token list. This results in the trust
   token not being invalidated by the trustee's token revocation (bulk
   revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled
   or the trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache
   backend for tokens in Keystone are affected.
