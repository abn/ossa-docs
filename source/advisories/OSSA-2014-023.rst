Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Horizon
---------------------------------------
:Date: July 08, 2014

:Description:

   Jason Hullinger from Hewlett Packard, Craig Lorentzen from Cisco and
   Michael Xin from Rackspace reported 3 cross-site scripting (XSS)
   vulnerabilities in Horizon. A malicious Orchestration template owner or
   catalog may conduct an XSS attack once a corrupted template is used in
   the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon. A malicious Horizon user may
   store an XSS attack by creating a network with a corrupted name. A
   malicious Horizon administrator may store an XSS attack by creating a
   user with a corrupted email address. Once executed in a legitimate
   context these attacks may result in potential asset stealing (horizon
   user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management,
   tenants' confidential information, etc.). All Horizon setups are
   affected.
