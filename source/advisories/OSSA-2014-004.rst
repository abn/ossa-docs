Glance Swift store backend password leak
----------------------------------------
:Date: February 12, 2014

:Description:

   Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance
   logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING
   level as part of the URL when authentication to a store fails if image
   location is not disabled by policy or the store is a single-tenant
   configuration. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log
   aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this
   vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the
   Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups using the Swift store
   backend are affected.
