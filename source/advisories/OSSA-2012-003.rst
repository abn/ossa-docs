Long server names grow nova-api log files significantly
-------------------------------------------------------
:Date: March 29, 2012

:Description:

   Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in OpenStack Compute (Nova) API
   servers. By PUTing or POSTing extremely long server names to the
   OpenStack API, any authenticated user may grow nova-api log files
   significantly, potentially resulting in disk space exhaustion and denial
   of service to the affected nova-api nodes. only setups running the
   OpenStack API are affected.
