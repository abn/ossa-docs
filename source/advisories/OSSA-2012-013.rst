Lack of authorization for adding users to tenants
-------------------------------------------------
:Date: August 30, 2012

:Description:

   Dolph Mathews reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When attempting to
   update a user's default tenant, Keystone will only partially deny the
   request when a user is not authorized to complete  this action. The API
   responds with 401 Not Authorized and the user's default tenant is not
   changed. However, the user is still granted membership to this new
   tenant.The result is that any client  that can reach the administrative
   API (deployed on port 35357, by default) can add any user to any tenant.
