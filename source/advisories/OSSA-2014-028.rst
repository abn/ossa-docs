Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion
----------------------------------------------
:Date: August 21, 2014

:Description:

   Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a
   vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance
   store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the
   image_size_cap configuration option is not honored. This may prevent
   further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Note that the
   import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are
   affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).

:Products affected:

   
   - glance: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2
