EC2-style authentication accepts disabled user/tenants
------------------------------------------------------
:Date: February 19, 2013

:Description:

   Nathanael Burton reported a vulnerability in EC2-style authentication in
   Keystone. Keystone fails to check whether a user, tenant, or domain is
   enabled  before authenticating a user using the EC2 api. Authenticated,
   but disabled users (or authenticated users in disabled tenants or
   domains) could therefore retain access rights that were thought removed.
   Only setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected. To disable
   EC2-style authentication to work around the issue, remove the EC2
   extension (keystone.contrib.ec2:Ec2Extension.factory) from the keystone
   API pipeline in keystone.conf.
