XSS vulnerability in Horizon log viewer
---------------------------------------
:Date: April 17, 2012

:Description:

   Matthias Weckbecker reported a vulnerability in Horizon. He noted that
   the log viewer refreshing mechanism does not escape the data fetched
   from guest consoles. This means that HTML with Javascript code gets
   interpreted as such, resulting in the ability to inject code into a
   dashboard session.
