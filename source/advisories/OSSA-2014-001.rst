Nova live snapshots use an insecure local directory
---------------------------------------------------
:Date: January 13, 2014

:Description:

   Daniel Berrange from Red Hat reported that the directories used to
   temporarily store live snapshots on Nova compute nodes were writable to
   all local users. A local attacker with shell access on compute nodes
   could therefore read and modify the contents of live snapshots before
   those are uploaded to the image service.
