Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend
---------------------------------------------
:Date: June 13, 2013

:Description:

   Jose Castro Leon from CERN reported a vulnerability in the way the
   Keystone LDAP backend authenticates users. When provided with an empty
   password, the backend would perform an anonymous LDAP bind that would
   result in successfully authenticating the user.  An attacker could
   therefore easily impersonate and get valid tokens for any user. Only
   Keystone setups using LDAP authentication backend are affected.
