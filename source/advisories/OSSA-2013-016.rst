Unchecked user input in Swift XML responses
-------------------------------------------
:Date: June 13, 2013

:Description:

   Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML handling
   within Swift account servers. Account strings were unescaped in XML
   listings, and an attacker could potentially generate unparsable or
   arbitrary XML responses which may be used to leverage other
   vulnerabilities in the calling software.
