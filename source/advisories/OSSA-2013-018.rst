Missing SSL certificate check in Python glance client
-----------------------------------------------------
:Date: July 30, 2013

:Description:

   Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Glance client was failing
   to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS
   connections. A remote attacker with access over segments of the network
   between client and server could potentially set up a man-in the-middle
   attack and access the contents of the Glance client request (or
   response).
