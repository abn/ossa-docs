Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants
---------------------------------------------
:Date: March 27, 2014

:Description:

   Aaron Rosen from VMware reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails to
   perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By choosing a
   device id of a router from a different tenant when creating a port, an
   authenticated user can access the network of other tenants. This affects
   deployments of Neutron using plugins relying on the l3-agent.
