Potential context confusion in Keystone middleware
--------------------------------------------------
:Date: March 27, 2014

:Description:

   Kieran Spear from the University of Melbourne reported a vulnerability
   in Keystone auth_token middleware (shipped in python-keystoneclient). By
   doing repeated requests, with sufficient load on the target system, an
   authenticated user may in certain situations assume another
   authenticated user's complete identity and multi-tenant authorizations,
   potentially resulting in a privilege escalation. Note that it is related
   to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached that should
   be avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches "thread" to use
   eventlet. Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache
   are vulnerable.
