Authentication bypass for image deletion
----------------------------------------
:Date: November 07, 2012

:Description:

   Gabe Westmaas from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Glance
   authentication of image deletion requests. Authenticated users may be
   able to delete arbitrary, non-protected images from Glance servers. Only
   Folsom/Grizzly deployments that expose the v1 API are affected by this
   vulnerability. Additionally, Essex deployments that use the
   delayed_delete option are also affected.
