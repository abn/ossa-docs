Keystone PKI tokens online validation bypasses revocation check
---------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: March 20, 2013

:Description:

   Guang Yee from HP reported a vulnerability in the revocation check for
   Keystone PKI tokens. Those tokens are supposed to be validated locally
   using cryptographic checks, but the user also has the option of asking
   the server to validate them. In that case, the online verification of
   PKI tokens would bypass the revocation check, potentially affirming
   revocated tokens are still valid. Only Folsom setups making use of
   online verification of PKI tokens are affected.
