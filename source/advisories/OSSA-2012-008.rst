Arbitrary file injection/corruption through directory traversal
---------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: July 03, 2012

:Description:

   Matthias Weckbecker from SUSE Security team reported a vulnerability in
   Nova compute nodes handling of file injection in disk images. By
   requesting iles to be injected in malicious paths, a remote
   authenticated user could inject files in arbitrary locations on the host
   file system, potentially resulting in full compromise of the compute
   node. Only Essex and later setups running the OpenStack API over
   libvirt-based hypervisors are affected. Upon further inspection of the
   code, Pádraig Brady from Red Hat found an additional vulnerability. By
   crafting a malicious image and requesting an instance based on it, a
   remote authenticated user may corrupt arbitrary files on the host
   filesystem, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects
   all setups.
