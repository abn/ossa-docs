Use of non-constant time comparison operation
---------------------------------------------
:Date: July 17, 2014

:Description:

   Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability in
   Nova.   By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata,
   an attacker  may be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This
   could allow access  to important configuration details of another
   instance. Only setups  configured to proxy metadata requests via Neutron
   are affected.
