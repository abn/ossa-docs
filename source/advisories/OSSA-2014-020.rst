XSS in Swift requests through WWW-Authenticate header
-----------------------------------------------------
:Date: June 19, 2014

:Description:

   Globo.com Security Team reported a vulnerability in Swift's header value
   escaping. By tricking a Swift user into clicking a malicious URL, a
   remote attacker may inject data in Swift response while still appearing
   to come from the Swift server, potentially leading to other client-side
   vulnerabilities. All Swift setups are affected.
