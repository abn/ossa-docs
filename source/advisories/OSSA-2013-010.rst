Nova uses insecure keystone middleware tmpdir by default
--------------------------------------------------------
:Date: May 09, 2013

:Description:

   Grant Murphy from Red Hat and Anton Lundin both independently reported a
   vulnerability in Nova's default location for the Keystone middleware
   signing directory (signing_dir). By previously setting up a malicious
   directory structure, an attacker with local shell access on the Nova
   node could potentially issue forged tokens that would be accepted by the
   middleware. Only setups that use the default value for signing_dir are
   affected. Note that future versions of the Keystone middleware will
   issue a warning if an insecure signing directory is used.
