Potential Nova denial of service through compressed disk images
---------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: October 31, 2013

:Description:

   Bernhard M. Wiedemann from SUSE reported a vulnerability in Nova's
   control of the size of disk images. By using malicious compressed qcow2
   disk images, an authenticated user may consume large amounts of disk
   space for each image, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service
   attack on Nova compute nodes (CVE-2013-4463). While fixing this issue,
   Pádraig Brady from Red Hat additionally discovered that OSSA 2013-012
   did not fully address CVE-2013-2096 in the non-default case where
   use_cow_images=False, and malicious qcow images are being transferred
   from Glance. In that specific case, an authenticated user could still
   consume large amounts of disk space for each instance using the
   malicious image, potentially also resulting in a Denial of Service
   attack on Nova compute nodes (CVE-2013-4469). The provided fixes address
   both issues.
