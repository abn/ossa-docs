Keystone privilege escalation through trust chained delegation
--------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: June 12, 2014

:Description:

   Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone chained
   delegation. By creating a delegation from a trust or OAuth token, a
   trustee may abuse the identity impersonation against keystone and
   circumvent the enforced scope, resulting in potential elevated
   privileges to any of the trustor's projects and or roles. All Keystone
   deployments configured to enable trusts are affected, which has been the
   default since Grizzly.
