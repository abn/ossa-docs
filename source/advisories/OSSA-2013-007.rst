Backend credentials leak in Glance v1 API
-----------------------------------------
:Date: March 14, 2013

:Description:

   Stuart McLaren from HP reported a vulnerability in the information
   potentially returned to the user in Glance v1 API. If an authenticated
   user requests, through the v1 API, an image that is already cached, the
   headers returned may disclose the Glance operator's backend credentials
   for that endpoint. Only setups accepting the Glance v1 API and using
   either the single-tenant Swift store or S3 store are affected.
