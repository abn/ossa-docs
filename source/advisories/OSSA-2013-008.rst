Nova DoS by allocating all Fixed IPs
------------------------------------
:Date: March 14, 2013

:Description:

   Vish Ishaya reported a vulnerability in Nova where there is no quota for
   Fixed IPs. Previously the instance quota acted as a proxy for a Fixed IP
   quota, but if your configuration allows an instance to consume more than
   one Fixed IP via an extension such as multinic then this is no longer
   true. Running out of Fixed IPs would result in not being able to spawn
   new instances.
