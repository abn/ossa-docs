Neutron security groups bypass through invalid CIDR
---------------------------------------------------
:Date: April 22, 2014

:Description:

   Stephen Ma from Hewlett Packard and Christoph Thiel from Deutsche
   Telekom reported a vulnerability in Neutron security groups. By creating
   a security group rule with an invalid CIDR, an authenticated user may
   break openvswitch-agent process, preventing further rules from being
   applied on the host. Note: removal of the faulty rule is not enough, the
   openvswitch-agent must be restarted. All Neutron setups using Open
   vSwitch are affected.
