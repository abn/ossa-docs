EC2-style credentials invalidation issue
----------------------------------------
:Date: November 28, 2012

:Description:

   Vijaya Erukala reported a vulnerability in Keystone EC2-style
   credentials invalidation: when a user is removed from a tenant, issued
   EC2-style credentials would continue to be valid for that tenant. An
   authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage this
   vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account owner
   expectations. Only setups enabling EC2-style credentials (for example
   enabling EC2 API in Nova) are affected.
