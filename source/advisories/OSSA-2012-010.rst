Various Keystone token expiration issues
----------------------------------------
:Date: July 27, 2012

:Description:

   Derek Higgins reported various issues affecting Keystone token
   expiration. A token expiration date can be circumvented by continuously
   creating new tokens before the old one has expired. Existing tokens also
   remain valid after a user account is disabled or after an account
   password changed. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially
   leverage those vulnerabilities to extend his access beyond the account
   owner expectations.
