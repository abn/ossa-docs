Path traversal issues registering malicious images using EC2 API
----------------------------------------------------------------
:Date: December 13, 2011

:Description:

   David Black reported two issues in OpenStack Nova's support for EC2
   RegisterImage action. By registering images from malicious tarballs or
   manifests, an attacker could potentially traverse directories and
   overwrite files with the rights of the user Nova runs under. Only setups
   allowing the EC2 API and the S3/RegisterImage method for registering
   images are affected.
