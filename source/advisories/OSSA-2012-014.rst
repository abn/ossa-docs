Revoking a role does not affect existing tokens
-----------------------------------------------
:Date: September 12, 2012

:Description:

   Dolph Mathews reported a vulnerability in Keystone. Granting and
   revoking roles from a user is not reflected upon token validation for
   pre-existing tokens. Pre-existing tokens continue to be valid for the
   original set of roles for the remainder of the token's lifespan, or
   until explicitly invalidated. This fix invalidates all tokens held by a
   user upon role grant/revoke to circumvent the issue.
