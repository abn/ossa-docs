Open redirect through 'next' parameter
--------------------------------------
:Date: August 30, 2012

:Description:

   Thomas Biege from SUSE reported a vulnerability in Horizon
   authentication mechanism. By adding a malicious 'next' parameter to a
   Horizon authentication URL and enticing an unsuspecting user to follow
   it, the victim might get redirected after authentication to a malicious
   site where useful information could be extracted. Only setups running
   Essex are affected.
