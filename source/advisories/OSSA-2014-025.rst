Denial of Service in Neutron allowed address pair
-------------------------------------------------
:Date: July 17, 2014

:Description:

   Liping Mao from Cisco reported a denial of service vulnerability in
   Neutron's handling of allowed address pair. By creating a large number
   of allowed address pairs, an authenticated user may overwhelm neutron
   firewall rules and render compute nodes unusable. All Neutron setups are
   affected.
