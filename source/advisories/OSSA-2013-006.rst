VNC proxy can connect to the wrong VM
-------------------------------------
:Date: February 26, 2013

:Description:

   Loganathan Parthipan (HP) and Rohit Karajgi (NTT Data) independently
   reported a vulnerability in Nova. If a user requests a console and then
   deletes the VM, it is possible that the console token could allow
   connectivity to a different VM before the console token expires if the
   VNC port gets reused in that time period. This issue can be worked
   around by disabling VNC support.
