Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet
----------------------------------------
:Date: June 18, 2014

:Description:

   Thiago Martins from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Neutron
   L3-agent. By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an
   authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating
   IPv4 addresses from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal
   of the faulty network can not be done using the API and must be cleaned
   at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are
   affected.
