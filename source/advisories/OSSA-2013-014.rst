Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI tokens validation
----------------------------------------------------------
:Date: May 28, 2013

:Description:

   Eoghan Glynn from Red Hat and Alex Meade from Rackspace both reported a
   vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone
   authentication middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could
   continue to be used, potentially resulting in the bypass of intended
   security policies. The effect of PKI token revocation is also reversed
   when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once again
   treated as being valid. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.
