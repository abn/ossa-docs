Compute node filesystem injection/corruption
--------------------------------------------
:Date: August 07, 2012

:Description:

   Pádraig Brady from Red Hat discovered that the fix implemented for
   CVE-2012-3361 (OSSA-2012-008) was not covering all attack scenarios. By
   crafting a malicious image with root-readable-only symlinks and
   requesting a server based on it, an authenticated user could still
   corrupt arbitrary files (all setups affected) or inject arbitrary files
   (Essex and later setups with OpenStack API enabled and a libvirt-based
   hypervisor) on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in full
   compromise of that compute node.
