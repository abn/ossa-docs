Tenant bypass by authenticated users using OpenStack API
--------------------------------------------------------
:Date: January 11, 2012

:Description:

   Nachi Ueno (NTT PF lab), Rohit Karajgi (Vertex) and Venkatesan Ravikumar
   (HP) discovered a vulnerability in Nova API nodes handling of incoming
   requests. An authenticated user may craft malicious commands to affect
   resources on tenants he is not a member of, potentially leading to
   incorrect billing, quota escaping or compromise of computing resources
   created by a third-party. Only setups allowing the OpenStack API are
   affected.
