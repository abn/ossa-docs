Backend password leak in Glance error message
---------------------------------------------
:Date: January 29, 2013

:Description:

   Dan Prince of Red Hat discovered an issue in Glance error reporting. By
   creating an image in Glance by URL that references a mis-configured
   Swift endpoint, or if the Swift endpoint that a previously-ACTIVE image
   references for any reason becomes unusable, an authenticated user may
   access the  Glance operator's Swift credentials for that endpoint. Only
   setups that use the single-tenant Swift store are affected.
