No quota enforced on security group rules
-----------------------------------------
:Date: April 19, 2012

:Description:

   Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in Nova. He discovered that there
   was no limit on the number of security group rules a user can create. By
   creating a very large set of rules, an unreasonable number of iptables
   rules will be created on compute nodes, resulting in a denial of
   service.
