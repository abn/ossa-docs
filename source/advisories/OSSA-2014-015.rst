Keystone user and group id mismatch
-----------------------------------
:Date: May 21, 2014

:Description:

   Michael Stancampiano from IBM reported a vulnerability in Keystone.
   Someone with write access to the user and group repository (such as the
   LDAP directory server) may willingly or unwillingly grant additional
   rights by picking the same IDs for users and groups, resulting in roles
   assigned to a group being assigned to the affected user even if he is
   not a member of this group. Only Keystone setups using LDAP for the
   Identity driver are affected.
