Unintentional role granting with Keystone LDAP backend
------------------------------------------------------
:Date: October 30, 2013

:Description:

   The IBM OpenStack test team reported a vulnerability in role change code
   within the Keystone LDAP backend. When a role on a tenant is removed
   from a user, and that user doesn't have that role on the tenant, then
   the user may actually be granted the role on the tenant. A user could
   use social engineering and leverage that vulnerability to get extra
   roles granted, or may accidentally be granted extra roles. Only Keystone
   setups using a LDAP backend are affected.
